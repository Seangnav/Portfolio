								<h2>My Journey</h2>
								<p>
                                    Hello! My name is Sean Vang. My journey started as a high school senior who wasn’t sure which college to attend or what major to pursue. At the time, football was a big part of my life — I was honored to serve as senior captain, and I thought sports would be my main focus in college. But after the season ended, I realized my passion for football was shifting, and I began to think more seriously about my future studies. With encouragement from my parents and former coach, I decided to explore Computer Science.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Fast forward to my freshman year of college. I enrolled in an Introduction to Computer Science course and was instantly hooked. The problem-solving, creativity, and challenge drew me in, and I knew right away I wanted to major in it.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Now, as I enter my third year, my passion for Computer Science has only continued to grow. I’ve become an active member of the CS club, built strong connections with my professors, and dedicated countless hours to improving my coding skills. Each project deepens my interest in software development, while also encouraging me to explore skills beyond programming. As a young developer, I’m eager to keep learning and expanding my experience, even though I’m still exploring the exact career path as I am learning more about IT, Cybersecurity, and Cloud Computing. I am still very excited about the opportunities ahead.
